## <span style="text-decoration: underline">What is Big O notation and why web developers should know about it:</span>

Big O notation is very well known in the computer programming and computer science industries. An interesting fact is that Big O notation is also known as "Landau's symbol" and it is used in mathematics, complexity theory as well as in computer science. The O within the name symbolises the "order of magnitude" which referes to the rate of growth of a particular function.

So this is allgood and well you might be thinking but what does Big O notation actually do? Well, let's take a look at that... The role of Big O notation is to determine the amount of time a particular algorithm will take to complete which is known as "time complexity", another functions that Big O notation performs is to check the "space complexity" that a particular algorithm will take to complete which indicates the amount of computer memory that the algorithm will need to run.
